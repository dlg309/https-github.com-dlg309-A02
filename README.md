Part 2 - Glossary of Terms
Branch - Think of this as your own lane in a project. It lets you work on new features or fixes without messing with the main code.

Clone - This just means making a copy of a remote repository on your computer so you can work on it locally.

Commit - A commit is a snapshot. Whenever you save a set of changes to your files, that’s a commit. It helps you keep track of what changed and when.

Fetch - When you fetch, you’re just grabbing the latest updates from a remote repository, but you’re not combining them with your own work yet.

Git - Git is the tool developers use to track changes in their source code. It keeps everything organized, even when lots of people are working on the same project.

GitHub - An online platform for hosting Git repositories, sharing them, and collaborating with others. It’s like a home base for your code.

Merge - Merging takes changes from one branch and combines them into another. It’s how separate lines of work come back together.

Merge Conflict  - Sometimes, changes from different branches clash, and Git can’t figure out which one to keep. That’s a merge conflict, and you’ll need to sort it out yourself.

Push  - When you push, you’re sending your commits from your computer to the remote repository, so others can see your updates.

Pull  - Pulling means you’re getting the latest changes from the remote repository and adding them to your local copy.

Remote -  A remote is just a version of your repository that lives online, like on GitHub.

Repository - This is the main folder where all your project files and the whole history of changes live, managed by Git.
